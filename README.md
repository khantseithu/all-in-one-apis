# All in One APIs

## Problem

We are trying to build a single source API hub that can be used to learn api handling in any programming language. Users can build their front end portfolio in web and mobile apps using this api hub.

The project focuses on delivering a wide range of APIs that cater to various domains and functionalities, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate these APIs into their applications.
